### Features plan
- [x] Remove boilerplate code, prepare for Obsidian plugin store submission
- [ ] Correct render for subtasks. Currently, everything rendered as a list
- [x] Let the user specify the default prefix for tasks. Currently, it is `*`
- [x] Timezone support. Currently, the plugin uses the timezone of the computer and tries to calculate the time difference between the computer and the Todoist server. This is not always correct. And is not tested on different timezones.
