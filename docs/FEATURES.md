### Features plan
- [x] Remove boilerplate code, prepare for Obsidian plugin store submission.
- [x] Correct render for subtasks. 
  - Currently, everything rendered as a list
- [x] Let the user specify the default prefix for tasks. 
  - Currently, it is `*` (bulletpoint)
- [x] Timezone support
  - Currently, the plugin uses the timezone of the computer and tries to calculate the time difference between the computer and the Todoist server
  - This is not always correct. And is not tested on different timezones
- [x] Fetch completed tasks for >1 day.
  - Currently, the plugin fetches only tasks completed today from 00:00 to 23:59
